This Java program displays a simple menu with four options: printing "Hello," printing "World," adding two numbers, or exiting. The user is prompted to enter a number corresponding to their choice. If they choose option 3, they are asked to input two numbers, which are then displayed. If they choose option 4, the program exits. If an invalid number is entered, an error message is shown. The program runs once and then terminates.
